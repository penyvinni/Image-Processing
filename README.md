# Image-Processing
This paper focuses on the application of image filters and image enhancement techniques using MATLAB or Octave.

1. Application of medium and median filters:
   - Applying a median filter with zero padding and a median filter with reflective padding to a matrix representing an image.
   - Confirming the results with MATLAB/Octave code.
     
2. Image Enhancement:
   - Examination of three images (lenna1.png, lenna2.png, lenna3.png) to determine the type of degradation they have undergone.
   - Suggestions for improving the quality of the images and implementation of these techniques with MATLAB/Octave code.
     
3. Αφαίρεση Περιοδικής Παραμόρφωσης:
   - Calculation of the two-dimensional Fourier transform in an image with periodic distortion.
   - Removal of distortion regions and restoration of the image in the spatial domain by inverse transformation.

This work includes theoretical approaches and practical implementations through programming, making it ideal for learning image processing.
